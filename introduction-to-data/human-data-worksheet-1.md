To do so, we need to understand the fundamentals of data analysis: Sort, Filter, Group by, Roll up, Count, and Unique Key.

**Sort:** Sorting is the process of arranging data into meaningful order so that you can analyze it more effectively. Commonly, we sort text data alphabetically, and numeric data numerically, from min to max, or max to min.

**Filter:** Filtering is the process of narrowing down data so that only a specific subset of a large database is displayed.

**Group by:** Aggregating individual observations of a variable into groups (a frequency distribution of these groups then serves as a convenient means of summarizing or analyzing the data).

**Roll-up:** Summarizing data along a dimension, often using the function Count.

**Unique Identifier (item)** : A unique identifier (UID) is a numeric or alphanumeric string that is associated with a single entity within a given system. UIDs make it possible to address that entity, so that it can be accessed and interacted with.

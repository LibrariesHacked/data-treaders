### Session pitches

You don't have to come with anything prepared, but if there's a topic you'd like to discuss you could think about giving it a title and how to explain it in a short pitch (no more than a minute!).

### Equipment

A laptop would be useful for both of the practical workshops, particularly if you'd like to get hands on experience with OpenRefine. However, do feel free to come along without one if more convenient, there'll be plenty of opportunity to follow along, and lots of discussions where there'll be no need for a laptop.

#### Introduction to Data

If taking part in this session it would be useful to have spreadsheet software, or access to Google Sheets (or an online alternative).

#### OpenRefine

If you'd like to take part in the Open Refine workshop, you could install OpenRefine v2.7 in advance from http://openrefine.org/download.html, and download the latest data we'll be using from https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/ncclibs-catalogue-titles. We'll also provide installation support on the day, and there'll be a demonstration of the software if you're not able to install it.

### Refreshments

Refreshments, including lunch, will be provided throughout the day.

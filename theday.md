### Equipment

Both of the practical sessions will include workshops (Introduction to Data, and OpenRefine) where a laptop would be useful. However, do feel free to come along without one if more convenient, there'll be plenty of opportunity to follow along and lots of discussions!

#### Introduction to Data

If taking part in this session it would be useful to have spreadsheet software, or access to Google Sheets.

#### OpenRefine

If you'd like to take part in the Open Refine workshop, you could install OpenRefine v2.7 in advance from http://openrefine.org/download.html, and download the latest data we'll be using from https://datamillnorth.org/dataset/ncclibs-catalogue-titles. But we'll provide installation support on the day, and there'll be a demonstration of the software if you're not able to install it.

### Refreshments

Refreshments, including lunch, will be provided throughout the day.

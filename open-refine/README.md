Open Refine Introduction and Workshop
-------------------------------------

OpenRefine is a powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with web services and external data.

An OpenRefine introduction and workshop will be delivered by Owen Stephens. The introduction will give attendees the opportunity to see the software, and what it can do. The workshop will provide an opportunity to get hands on experience.

Owen has put together a set of materials in a Google document at [http://bit.ly/2ipFJnJ](http://bit.ly/2ipFJnJ).

This has links to lots more information online, including the full Library Carpentry lesson.
